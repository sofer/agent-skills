# Code review

## Purpose

Provide a fresh, critical review of code changes. Prioritise correctness, security, behavioural regressions, ownership boundaries, and missing tests.

## Inputs

Accept any of:
- PR URL or number.
- Branch name.
- Commit range.
- Staged or unstaged local diff.
- File list.
- Spec, plan, or acceptance criteria.

If the goal of the change is unclear, infer from PR text, commit messages, docs, tests, or surrounding code. Ask only if ambiguity affects the review.

## Safety

- Reading PRs, diffs, files, and local test results is allowed.
- Do not post GitHub comments, approve, request changes, push, merge, or create PRs without explicit confirmation.
- Do not modify code during a review unless the user explicitly asks for fixes.
- Preserve user work. Do not revert or overwrite unrelated changes.

## Review process

1. Identify the scope:
   - files changed
   - intended behaviour
   - tests changed or missing
   - shared files or boundaries touched
2. Inspect repo instructions, especially `AGENTS.md`, when reviewing non-trivial work.
3. Review the diff and relevant surrounding code.
4. Check the change against:
   - stated goal or acceptance criteria
   - existing patterns and interfaces
   - security and privacy
   - error handling
   - data and migration safety
   - auth, email, payments, permissions, or production-impacting behaviour
   - test coverage and verification quality
5. Run or inspect relevant checks when feasible. If checks are not run, state the gap.
6. Produce findings ordered by severity.

## Severity

- `Blocking`: must fix before merge, release, or commit. Examples: data loss, security flaw, broken core behaviour, unsafe migration, auth bypass.
- `Important`: should fix before shipping unless there is a deliberate tradeoff. Examples: likely bug, weak test harness, brittle integration, unclear shared-boundary impact.
- `Minor`: worth considering, but does not block. Examples: small maintainability issue, local naming inconsistency.

Avoid style-only comments unless they create real maintainability or correctness risk.

## Output

Lead with findings. If there are no findings, say so clearly.

```markdown
## Findings

1. [Severity] [Title] - [file:line]
   [Why this matters.]
   Suggested fix: [Concrete action.]

## Open questions
- [Question that affects correctness, scope, or risk.]

## Verification
- [Checks run or reviewed.]
- [Checks not run and why.]

## Boundary notes
- [For platform work: Distribution/Partners status and shared files touched.]

## Summary
[One or two sentences only.]
```

## GitHub review posting

If the user asks to post review comments:
1. Show the exact review body and inline comments first.
2. Ask for confirmation.
3. Post only after confirmation.
4. Keep comments concise and actionable.
5. Never include AI-tool attribution.
